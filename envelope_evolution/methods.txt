Build semi non-redundant viral envelope database, then search some ancient genomes

1. Download all envelope proteins from >100 aa to 1500 aa
307926 hits (6/12/2021)
308033 hits (for 150 to 5000 aa in length, so exclude large ones)

1.1. All vs All BLAST to remove redundancy
First clean up: Removal all the trivial 95%+ 100% length matches;
(Probably best to then do the BLAST again?)
Pack all the similar sequences into bundles. 

Clustal each bundle? 

1.3. Clustal representatives from each bundle.

Somehow work out how old they might be?

2. Get all possible ORFs from the Lamprey and B.Lancoleatum genomes > 50 aa in length

3. BLAST it with the env database

4. Model good hits with AlphaFold
